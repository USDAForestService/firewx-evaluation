solar_input.csv is an example input csv for use with computeSolar. Example usage:

./computeSolar --csv solar_input.csv

The input csv must consist of comma-separated values without spaces. Each column is an
input and each row is a separate run. The order of inputs is the same as on the command 
line:

year,month,day,hour,minute,second,lat,lon,timezone

If an input file is provided with the --csv option an output file called solopos_output.csv
will be created in the working directory. The output file will have one row for each run. 
Each row will contain the input values and the calculated solar radiation in the last column:

year,month,day,hour,minute,second,lat,lon,timezone,solarradiation
